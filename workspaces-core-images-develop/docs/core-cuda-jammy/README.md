# About This Image

This image contains a browser-accessible version of Ubuntu Jammy including the CUDA toolkit.

This image is used by our open-source containerized [Machine Learning Desktop](https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-machine-learning) and our [Data Science Desktop](https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-data-science). The core image should be used as a base to create your own derivative images, or you can modify our ML or data science images to meet your needs. All images are intended to be used with the NVIDIA container toolkit to pass GPU capabilities into the containerized desktop, which is pre-loaded with your favorite development and data science tools and libraries.
